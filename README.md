## Goal

This project is focused around simulating the birthday paradox.

> The birthday paradox, also known as the birthday problem, states that in a random group of 23 people, there is about a 50 percent chance that two people have the same birthday.

The specific calculations end up as:
> Chance of no shared birthday:
> 
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{364!}{342!*365^{22}}&space;=&space;0.492703" title="\frac{364!}{342!*365^{22}} = 0.492703" />
>
> Chance there is a shared birthday:
> 
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?1&space;-&space;0.492703&space;=&space;0.507297" title="1 - 0.492703 = 0.507297" />


This means that there is about a 50.7% chance that there is a shared birthday in a group of 23 people which I find very hard to believe. I found this to be a really intriguing, so I decided to start this small project focused on proving the validity of this.
