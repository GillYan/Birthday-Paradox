## Goal

This project is focused around simulating the birthday paradox.

> The birthday paradox, also known as the birthday problem, states that in a random group of 23 people, there is about a 50 percent chance that two people have the same birthday.

I found this to be a really intriguing concept, so I decided to start this small project.
